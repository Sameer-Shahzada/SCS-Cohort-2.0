// -> Trapping Rain Water 

/*
    Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the 
    width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

    Example 1:
    Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1];
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array
    [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are 
    being trapped.

    Example 2:
    Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
    Output:9

    Contraints:
    n == height.length 
    1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4 
    0 <= height[i] <= 10^5

        maxLeft = Math.max(height[i], maxLeft)
        left[i] = maxLeft;
    }
